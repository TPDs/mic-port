		<p>
			I want to make something, but ... what? <br />What do people want or what would I enjoy to
			make?
			<br />I guess people don't know what they want untill they see it ü§î <br /> <br /> <br />
			<b>Guess I need to look around ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</b>
		</p>
		<br /><br />
		<p>
			Think I will do a daily sprint for one project, like a 8h run, to see how I can improve myself
			and tune my skills with limited time
