		<b>What to create?</b> <br> <br>

		<p>I want to make something, but ... what? <br>What do people want or what would I enjoy to make?
		<br>I guess people don't know what they want untill they see it  🤔 <br> <br> <br>
			<b>Guess I need to look around 🤷‍♂️</b>
		</p>

		<p>Think I will do a daily sprint for one project, like a 8h run, to see how I can improve myself and tune my skills with limited time </p>
